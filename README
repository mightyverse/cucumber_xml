Dependencies
--------------
Rails (you could run these steps with older versions of Rails, but this app was generated with 2.3.2)

sudo gem install rspec rspec-rails cucumber webrat
sudo gem install xmlsubsetmatcher

Steps for creating this project
-------------------------------
rails cucumber_xml
./script/generate scaffold project name:string notes:text complete:boolean
ruby script/generate cucumber
write a feature description and run it:
   features/project_create_xml.feature
   rake features

write a feature description that references an XML fixture, and DB fixture data to match:
  features/project_xml.feature
  features/xml/projects.xml
  test/fixtures/projects.yml

  note that cucumber has its own RAILS_ENV
  to see what cucumber sees:
    rake db:fixtures:load RAILS_ENV=cucumber
    ./script/server -e cucumber

  configure xmlsubsetmatcher
  add the following line to the botton of /features/support/env.rb
      World(CustomMatchers)
  add the following to your environment.rb (not sure why latest nokogiri goesn't work for me):
      config.gem "nokogiri", :version => '=1.2.3'
